It's also great when you customers cannot live without their MS Access, and you - the developer - cannot live another day in the RDBMS world...\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n--------------------\r\nAfter you set it up, this tool works in two phases:\r\n1. First you model your data... automatically. After running the modeler SP, you will get model tables that contain the best representation of all fields found in the targeted view from Couchbase. Then you will review the model tables, rename abbreviated columns to sthg_more_sensbl, and when you are done, you will run the synchronization SP.\r\n2. Synchronizing - After the database is modeled, you can ask your favorite oracle DBA to schedule the sync SP to run every 5-6 minutes, as often as the requirement calls.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSS Mentions\r\n--------------------\r\nThis solution uses joda-time verbatim, with only the modifications that will make it compile under JDK5. This solution also uses the JSON parser from http://www.json.org with the modification on the JSONObject to use LinkedHashMap so it preserves the order of JSON properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n--------------------\r\nYou may require various grants to your schema to perform the installation and configuration. Generally, they boil down to permissions to deploy Java objects, create and execute procedures, and establish TCP connections to all of your Couchbase servers for ports 8091 and 11210. You should be best friends with your DBA at this point.\r\n\r\n1. Get the source\r\n2. Download JDK5 as this code is written for Oracle 10g which ships with its own custom jre 1.5. Oracle 12c will have JRE1.6 and that will be more fun.\r\n3. Get Ant if you don't have it already. We will maven-ize this for Oracle 12c.\r\n4. Run ant in the folder with the build.xml file\r\n5. Go to target and deploy the jars in the following order:\r\n```bash\t\r\n\ta. loadjava -user username/password@tnsname -resolve CartridgeServices.jar\r\n\tb. loadjava -user username/password@tnsname -resolve ODCI.jar\r\n\tc. loadjava -user username/password@tnsname -resolve joda-time-convert-2.3-jdk5.jar\r\n\td. loadjava -user username/password@tnsname -resolve cb2oracle.jar\r\n```\r\nNow go in your favourite Oracle administration tool and verify that all Java objects are valid.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n--------------------\r\nOpen your Oracle admin tool (Toad, SQL Developer, ...) and connect to the schema that you deployed the Java objects to. We need to register seven stored procedures that will implement the entire solution.\r\n```sql\r\n1. CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CBMODELER_SETUP AS LANGUAGE JAVA NAME 'CouchbaseModeler.setup()';\r\n2. CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CBMODELER_REGISTERVIEW(UNIQUENAME IN VARCHAR2, URL IN VARCHAR2, BUCKET IN VARCHAR2, PASS IN VARCHAR2, DDOC IN VARCHAR2, VIEWNAME IN VARCHAR2 ) AS LANGUAGE JAVA NAME 'CouchbaseModeler.registerView(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String)';\r\n3. CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CBMODELER_MODELVIEW(UNIQUENAME IN VARCHAR2, ROOTXPATH IN VARCHAR2, TABLENAMEXPATH IN VARCHAR2, SAMPLESIZE IN NUMBER) AS LANGUAGE JAVA NAME 'CouchbaseModeler.modelView(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.math.BigDecimal)';\r\n4. CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CBMODELER_MODELVIEW_ADDITIVE(UNIQUENAME IN VARCHAR2, ROOTXPATH IN VARCHAR2, TABLENAMEXPATH IN VARCHAR2, SAMPLESIZE IN NUMBER) AS LANGUAGE JAVA NAME 'CouchbaseModeler.modelViewAdditive(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.math.BigDecimal)';\r\n5. CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CBMODELER_CREATEVIEWTYPES(UNIQUENAME IN VARCHAR2) AS LANGUAGE JAVA NAME 'CouchbaseModeler.createViewTypes(java.lang.String)';\r\n6. CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CBMODELER_SYNCSETUP(UNIQUENAME IN VARCHAR2) AS LANGUAGE JAVA NAME 'CouchbaseSync.setupTables(java.lang.String)';\r\n7. CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CBMODELER_SYNC(UNIQUENAME IN VARCHAR2, ROOTTABLE IN VARCHAR2, TIMECOLUMN IN VARCHAR2) AS LANGUAGE JAVA NAME 'CouchbaseSync.synchronize(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String)';\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point you should have seven valid stored procedures. Here is how you finally link your Oracle to your Couchbase cluster.\r\n\r\nFirst run \r\n```sql\r\nEXEC CBMODELER_SETUP;\r\n```\r\nThis will create the two \"system\" tables (COUCHBASE_VIEWS$ and COUCHBASE_MODELS$) necessary for this solution to work. COUCHBASE_VIEWS$ will contain all connection information to the Couchbase cluster; COUCHBASE_MODELS$ will contain the mapping between JSON fields and tables/columns.\r\n\r\nNow run \r\n```sql\r\nEXEC CBMODELER_REGISTERVIEW('UNIQUENAME', 'COUCHBASE_URL', 'BUCKET', 'PASSWORD', 'DDOC', 'VIEW');\r\n```\r\nWhere UNIQUENAME is a recognizable name for this view (this is how you will refer to it from Oracle); COUCHBASE_URL is a URL to the Couchbase cluster similar to this \"http://myhostname.com:8092/\"; the rest are self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nIt's time to model the documents found in the view. Run this:\r\n```sql\r\nEXEC CBMODELER_MODELVIEW('UNIQUENAME', '', 'TABLENAMEXPATH', SAMPLE_SIZE);\r\n```\r\nTABLENAMEXPATH is the \"jxpath\" to a JSON field in all your documents returned by your view that is common (e.g. doctype, common/name). We will use this field to generate names for the relational tables that will be created.\r\n\r\nYou will most probably need to customize the generated model. There is a pretty bad limitation on the object name size in Oracle, so the modeling algorithm has to abbreviate those names. You should look into the COUCHBASE_MODELS$ table and review the data ORACLE_NAME column. The two basic rules are:\r\n1. The values must be 30 chars or smaller, and \r\n2. there should be no duplicates. \r\nYou can run:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM COUCHBASE_MODELS$ WHERE LENGTH(TABLE_NAME) > 24 OR LENGTH(ORACLE_NAME) > 30;\r\n```\r\nto double check the lengths of objects. The duplicates are for homework :)\r\n\r\nWhen you are done with the customizations it's time to create the tables that will represent the structure inferred from the sampled documents:\r\n```sql\r\nEXEC CBMODELER_CREATEVIEWTYPES('UNIQUENAME');\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo initialize the synchronization run:\r\n```sql\r\nEXEC CBMODELER_SYNCSETUP('UNIQUENAME');\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally, to perform your first sync, do:\r\n```sql\r\nEXEC CBMODELER_SYNC('UNIQUENAME', 'ROOTTABLE', 'TIMECOLUMN');\r\n```\r\nHere ROOTTABLE is the name of the generated table after the modeling process and TIMECOLUMN is the column in ROOTTABLE that has a time that is guaranteed (by your application) to be updated when the Couchbase document is updated.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can run the last step as often as you like. Unfortunately, it uses REST calls to the Couchbase cluster and not the more optimal NIO-based approach as implemented in the Java Couchbase Driver. Maybe when Oracle 12c wider acceptance (and we have JDK6!!!) we could use the drivers. And even then, when started, the driver creates threads which do not terminate until shutdown() is called (and as you probably know, if you spawn a thread in a Java method called as a Stored Procedure, the call is not going to terminate until all threads are done. Bummer...)\r\n\r\n\t\r\nLimitations\r\n------------------\r\nThis tool makes some very important assumptions.\r\n\r\n1. The data in the Couchbase documents is a JSON object {.....} - not an array.\r\n2. Arrays are converted to child tables, thus the elements of arrays must be objects, e.g.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  doctype: \"object templates\"\r\n  name: \"some intelligent object\",\r\n  agents : [\r\n    {name: \"Agent 1\", type: \"leader\"},\r\n    {name: \"Agent 2\", type: \"soldier\", weapon: \"bazooka\"},\r\n    {name: \"Agent 3\", type: \"spy\", special: \"stealth\"}\r\n  ] \r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis will create two tables: \"object_templates\" with columns (doctype, name) and \"object_templates_agents\" with columns (name, type, weapon, special)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
